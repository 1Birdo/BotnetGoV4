## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21+
- OpenSSL (for certificate generation)

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/golang-c2.git
cd golang-c2

# Generate certificates (requires OpenSSL)
mkdir -p certs
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/key.pem -out certs/cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/ca.key -out certs/ca.csr -nodes
openssl x509 -req -in certs/ca.csr -signkey certs/ca.key -out certs/ca.crt

# Build and run
go build -o c2server main.go
./c2server
```
