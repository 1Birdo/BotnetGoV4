A high-performance command and control (C2) server written in Go, featuring TLS encryption, rate limiting, attack queuing, and multi-user management with privilege levels.

To connect to the C2 server, you must use OpenSSL with the generated TLS certificates - standard SSH clients like PuTTY are not supported.
The recommended connection method is:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect [SERVER_IP]:[PORT] -cert client.crt -key client.key -CAfile ca.crt
```
This ensures proper certificate authentication and encrypted communication with the command-and-control interface. Make sure all certificate files (.crt, .key, and CA bundle) are in your working directory before attempting to connect.

# This is the old Demo video for it, Visuals have change for the better since then.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21+
- OpenSSL (for certificate generation)

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/golang-c2.git
cd golang-c2

# Generate certificates (requires OpenSSL)
mkdir -p certs
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/key.pem -out certs/cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/ca.key -out certs/ca.csr -nodes
openssl x509 -req -in certs/ca.csr -signkey certs/ca.key -out certs/ca.crt

# Build and run
go build -o c2server main.go
./c2server
```
