## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- Strong password requirements (minimum 12 chars, complexity enforced)
- Multi-factor authentication for admin accounts
- JWT-based session management with short expiration
- Role-based access control (Owner/Admin/Pro/Basic levels)
- Rate limiting on authentication attempts
- Secure password reset mechanism

### Network Security
- TLS 1.3 enforced for all communications
- Certificate pinning for C2 connections
- IP whitelisting/blacklisting capabilities
- SYN flood protection and other DDoS mitigations
- Connection rate limiting

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- Secure credential storage using bcrypt
- Command signing with HMAC-SHA256
- Audit logging of all security-relevant events

### Bot Security
- Challenge-response authentication for bots
- Secure heartbeat mechanism
- Automatic cleanup of inactive bots
- Anti-debugging techniques
- Persistence mechanisms

### Attack Prevention
- Input validation for all commands
- Restricted attack methods per user level
- Private IP range blocking
- Attack duration limits
- Concurrent attack limits

## Best Practices

### For Administrators
- Regularly rotate API keys and JWT secrets
- Monitor audit logs for suspicious activity
- Keep server software updated
- Use firewall rules to restrict access
- Implement regular backups

### For Users
- Never share your API keys or credentials
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Report suspicious activity immediately
- Log out after each session
- Regularly check your account activity

## Known Limitations

1. The self-signed certificate option should only be used for testing
2. The proxy component may be vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks
3. Some attack methods may be detectable by modern security systems
4. The persistence mechanism may not work on all Linux distributions
